# Connect LinkedIn by session cookie (recommended)

The most reliable, lowest-friction way to keep a user's automation logged in **without
triggering LinkedIn's "Check your app" new-device challenge** is to reuse their existing
LinkedIn session instead of doing a fresh password login.

## Why this works

LinkedIn challenges a login when it sees a **fresh password sign-in from a new
device/IP** — exactly what our Selenium login does. But if we present the user's already
established session cookie (`li_at`), LinkedIn sees a continued, trusted session and does
**not** challenge it. `login_to_linkedin` already tries stored cookies first, so once a
valid `li_at` is saved, the password step (and its 2FA challenge) is skipped entirely.

`li_at` is an **httpOnly** cookie — page JavaScript can't read it, which is why the
one-click capture uses a browser extension (the `chrome.cookies` API can).

## Option A — one-click browser extension (least steps)

`tools/linkedin-cookie-extension/` is a minimal Chrome/Edge MV3 extension.

1. `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** →
   select `tools/linkedin-cookie-extension/`.
2. Be signed in to `linkedin.com` in that browser.
3. Click the extension → set **LEM URL** (default prod) → paste your **LEM session
   token** once (saved locally) → **Connect**.

It reads `li_at` (+ `JSESSIONID`) and POSTs them to `POST /api/user/linkedin-cookie`.
After that, automation reuses the session; re-click **Connect** if the session ever
disconnects.

## Option B — manual paste (no extension)

1. On `linkedin.com`: DevTools (F12) → **Application** → **Cookies** →
   `https://www.linkedin.com` → copy the **Value** of `li_at`.
2. Send it to the endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "$LEM_URL/api/user/linkedin-cookie" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_token":"<your LEM session token>","li_at":"<li_at value>"}'
```

## The endpoint

`POST /api/user/linkedin-cookie` — body `{ session_token, li_at, jsessionid? }`.
Authenticated by the user's LEM `session_token`. Validates `li_at` and stores it via the
standard cookie store (`store_linkedin_li_at` → `store_cookies`), so the existing
cookie-first `login_to_linkedin` path picks it up. Returns 422 on a malformed `li_at`,
401 on a bad session.

## Security

`li_at` is **as sensitive as a password** — anyone holding it can act as that LinkedIn
user. It is the user's own session, sent only to their own LEM instance over HTTPS and
stored in the same `cookies` table the automation already uses. Treat it accordingly;
rotate by signing out of LinkedIn (which invalidates it) and reconnecting.

## Combine with the proxy (optional)

Cookie reuse removes the *login* challenge. Pairing it with a stable per-user egress
(`REGION_PROXIES`, see [`PER_USER_PROXY.md`](PER_USER_PROXY.md)) keeps the session's IP
consistent too — but it's no longer required just to log in.
