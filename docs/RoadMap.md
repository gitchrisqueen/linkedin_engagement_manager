# LinkedIn Engagement Manager (LEM) - Roadmap

## Project Timeline: 5 Days to MVP

This roadmap outlines the steps to take LinkedIn Engagement Manager (LEM) from scratch to an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Each day focuses on specific tasks that build on top of one another to ensure a rapid, functional product within 5 days.

### Day 1: Initial Setup and Infrastructure

- **Goal**: Set up the core infrastructure, including Docker, MySQL, and project skeleton.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up the **Docker environment** with separate containers for:
     - Python (Selenium and app logic)
     - MySQL (Database)
  2. Configure **Docker Compose** to ensure all services run together.
  3. Set up initial MySQL schema for storing posts, logs, and approval data.
  4. Initialize **Selenium** with a basic browser automation script (e.g., open LinkedIn and log in).
  5. Ensure basic connectivity between Python, Selenium, and MySQL.
  
- **Testing**: 
  - Verify that Docker containers can communicate with each other.
  - Ensure the database is reachable from the app.
  - Confirm Selenium script successfully opens LinkedIn.

### Day 2: Basic Automation and AI Integration

- **Goal**: Automate LinkedIn tasks and integrate AI content generation.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Extend the Selenium script to:
     - Comment on posts.
     - Send direct messages to profile viewers.
  2. Integrate AI content generation modules:
     - Generate simple text for comments and DMs using an AI service (e.g., OpenAI).
  3. Store AI-generated content in MySQL for scheduling purposes.
  
- **Testing**:
  - Automate commenting and DM-sending functionality on LinkedIn.
  - Verify that AI-generated content is correctly stored in the database.

### Day 3: Post Scheduling and Sentiment Analysis

- **Goal**: Add post scheduling and sentiment analysis for content validation.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up a post scheduler using **Celery** and **Redis** for task queuing.
  2. Implement sentiment analysis on AI-generated content using `VADER` or `TextBlob` to ensure appropriateness.
  3. Allow posts to be scheduled at specific times, store scheduling info in MySQL.
  
- **Testing**:
  - Verify scheduled posts appear at correct times.
  - Ensure content passes sentiment analysis before being queued for posting.

### Day 4: Preview and Approval System

- **Goal**: Enable a manual preview and approval workflow for all generated content.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Build a basic **web dashboard** (using Flask or FastAPI) to:
     - Display AI-generated content.
     - Allow users to manually approve or reject content.
  2. Add an option for **auto-approval**, so posts can be published without manual intervention.
  
- **Testing**:
  - Verify that content can be previewed and approved via the web interface.
  - Ensure approved content is correctly published and logged.

### Day 5: MVP Completion and Final Testing

- **Goal**: Polish the app and complete the MVP version.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Complete any remaining tasks from the previous days.
  2. Finalize the web dashboard to display scheduled tasks and allow monitoring of engagement activities.
  3. Perform **end-to-end testing**:
     - Full workflow from generating content to posting and engagement.
  4. Write basic documentation for deployment and usage.
  
- **Testing**:
  - Ensure the full system operates correctly: from content generation, scheduling, approval, to posting.
  - Test scalability using Docker.

## Post-MVP Roadmap

- **Post-MVP Improvements**:
  1. Implement advanced content analytics to measure engagement performance.
  2. Add support for more social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook).
  3. Explore options for AI-driven responses to comments.
  4. Expand the dashboard with deeper analytics and user customization options.
