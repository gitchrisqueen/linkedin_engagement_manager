// The feature story, told one beat at a time with a product visual each (issue #1300), replacing a
// three-card emoji grid whose bullets described a product more general than the one that exists.
//
// Every line below names something shipped. The four beats are the actual order of the loop:
// write it, schedule it, engage with it, then measure what it earned. Since #2366 the engagement
// beat describes suggestions the user sends, never actions LEM takes on their behalf.
